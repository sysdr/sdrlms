LearnPress Pro Theme Screenshot

For a proper WordPress theme screenshot, create a 1200x900px image showing:

1. Header with logo and navigation
2. Hero section with gradient background
3. Featured course carousel
4. Course grid with cards showing:
   - Course thumbnails
   - Titles
   - Ratings
   - Price badges
   - Instructor info
   - Enrollment buttons

Recommended tools to create screenshot:
- Take a screenshot of the live site after adding sample courses
- Use design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Photoshop
- Ensure it's 1200x900px exactly
- Save as screenshot.png in theme root

Color scheme to showcase:
- Primary blue: #0056d2
- Success green: #10b981
- Gradient backgrounds
- Clean white cards with shadows
- Modern typography (Source Sans Pro)

The screenshot should demonstrate the theme's modern, professional LMS design inspired by DeepLearning.AI and SystemDR.
